# Ultrasound 3D Reconstruction of Malignant Masses in Robotic-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy Using the PAF Rail System: a Comparison Study
## Abstract Purpose: 
In Robotic-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) the use
of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) helps to localise and outline the tumours as
well as the blood vessels within the kidney. The aim of this work is to evaluate
the use of the Pneumatically Attachable Flexible (PAF) rail system for US 3D
reconstruction of malignant masses in RAPN. The PAF rail system is a novel device developed and previously presented by the authors to enable track-guided US
scanning. Methods: We present a comparison study between US 3D reconstruction
of masses based on: the da Vinci Surgical System kinematics, single- and stereocamera tracking of visual markers embedded on the probe. An US-realistic kidney
phantom embedding a mass is used for testing. A new design for the US probe
attachment to enhance the performance of the kinematic approach is presented.
A feature extraction algorithm is proposed to detect the margins of the targeted
mass in US images. Results: To evaluate the performance of the investigated approaches the resulting 3D reconstructions have been compared to a CT scan of
the phantom. The data collected indicates that single camera reconstruction outperformed the other approaches, reconstructing with a sub-millimetre accuracy
the targeted mass. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that the PAF rail system
provides a reliable platform to enable accurate US 3D reconstruction of masses in
RAPN procedures. The proposed system has also the potential to be employed in
other surgical procedures such as hepatectomy or laparoscopic liver resection.
